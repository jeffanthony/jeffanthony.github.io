<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I have a fiance, Brie, we haven't set the date yet! We both have a daughter: one in her twenties and one teen.</p>
<p>I've recently overcome an illness which nearly turned fatal and still haunts me but, over the years I was essentially bedridden my mind was working as much as it could on what I would do when I was better. Well, now I'm better! check out my <a href="https://jeffanthony.github.io/currectProjects</p>
